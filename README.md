At this point in the course we are using Constructor.  Based on stuff I've read I don't think I would ever use Constructor.  Seems like Factory would be best, maybe class.

Issues/TODO:
- question about best practice for generating html from js
- realy need to start using modules, everything is global
- once again, not concerned with pretty, just covering functional so i can move on to backend
- the form for add new is not responsive, also esc key should make it go away
- all the cells could be made editable in the grid, not just the read cell
- simple save & load to sessionStorage; nothing automatic, if you add stuff you have to save
