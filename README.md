# top-js-library
The Odin Project, Full Stack JavaScript Path, JavaScript, Organizing your JavaScript Code, Project: Library

A later assignment has us go back to this project and change from Constructor to Class.

Issues/TODO:
- question about best practice for generating html from js
- realy need to start using modules, everything is global
- once again, not concerned with pretty, just covering functional so i can move on to backend
- the form for add new is not responsive, also esc key should make it go away
- all the cells could be made editable in the grid, not just the read cell
- simple save & load to sessionStorage; nothing automatic, if you add stuff you have to save
